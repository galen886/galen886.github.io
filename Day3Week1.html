    <h1> Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is my first try at creating a HTML page with structure, so as I go on this journey to write this, bare with me...i guess </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Galen, titled <em>Galen</em> or to some <strong>GALEN</strong></p>
    </section>
    <section>   
    <h2> Origin </h2>
       <p>Time and time again, <strong>GALEN</strong> felt underestimated, limited by those who claim were with or by his side, defeated at times he felt the strongest, and even not consider human at times. He is tormented with the fear of being displacement, and worries one day he will be forgotten, but as he worries one day of being forgotten, some days he finds himself wishing to be forgotten. He cannot make up his mind, as his mind is playing with him as if his life is a big game show that has a ending near.</p>
       <p>In times of loneliness, where <strong>GALEN</strong> could of recouped, and thought of ways to find himself on his path to glory, he often fell into the same trap as always and is at victim to the very thing he hates, being underestimated, being considered someone of the lowest form. Hanging around those who don't praise, but berate everything he sets his mind to, and by his surprise, he still doesn't know why he hasn't distanced himself from them, until today. </p>
       <p>After seeing himself almost become fallen into the very same trap that has kept him complacent for days and months, he decided to finally break out of that shell, and take a leap into something new, something that can help bring out the purpose of his life. So he walks out of his cave where, there is nothing but rocks and darkness and a minute bit of light, and sets his sights on trying to understand the unknown, and the reasoning as to why he continues to fall into this constant trap. </p>
